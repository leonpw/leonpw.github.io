## Projects & hackathons ##
***
<br>

#### 2022 Nov-Dec Layer Hack ðŸ¥‡ 1st price AltLayer challenge ($5k) ####

As team WenBounty we used our capstone project to participate to solve real world scenarios for the AltLayer challenge. As a member of the team I fixed smart-contract bugs, added support for the flash layer chain and deployed to production.

#### 2022 Oct-Nov Manifold MEV Bounty ðŸ¥ˆ 2nd place ($3k) ####


Manifoldâ€™s custom chain has different entities, both large and small, performing trades against DEX LPs and issuing transfers between each other. As a hacker, my objective is to develop and implement a working MEV trading system that can capitalize on inefficiencies within the custom chain and extract the maximal value from both the entities in the system and each other. Created a high-performing multi-threaded MEV-platform that listens to the chain 24/7. Developed smart-contracts for arbitrages and strategies. Deployed to docker containers in a private cloud instance as close as possible to the RPC-endpoint for lower latencies.


#### Misc projects ####

Running my own; VPN services, Compound-fork liquidation bots, Telegram bots. Created a Flashbots library for .NET.
