# WenBounty #

WenBounty simplifies prize distribution in hackathons. Sponsors can add prize money to a pool that auto-disburses funds to winners. This will benefit everyone in the following ways:
- Participants: Clear view of which track has the highest prize; speedy & automated prize distribution
- Organizers: No headache of constantly following up with sponsors and updating participants
- Sponsors: Optimize prize money like an auction- start with a small fund & add more basis participant responses.

# Manifold MEV bounty #

<p>
Within the Manifold MEV challenge, hackers searched for profitable opportunities on a custom EVM fork.

Manifoldâ€™s custom chain has different entities, both large and small, performing trades against DEX LPs and issuing transfers between each other. As a participant, your objective was to create a working MEV trading system that can capitalize on inefficiencies within our custom chain. As a searcher, you had to extract the maximal value from both the entities in the system and each other.

# Flashbots .NET lib #

The Flashbots.Console is a sample project on how to use the Web3.Flashbots. In the sample project 3 transactions will be created as a bundle. The bundle gets simulated and send to flashbots in the next block. The sample project is based on: https://github.com/flashbots/web3-flashbots

The Web3.Flashbots uses a FlashbotsRpcClient for adding the X-Flashbots-Signature. This was not possible with just the Nethereum library.
